synopsis: |
  We all use different patterns all the time, let's talk about them together.  The idea is we'll have several different speakers, each talking about a different design pattern along with some code (mostly code).
  If you'd like to contribute, and speak about your favorite pattern, just let us know!
  Current lineup:
    * Factory
    * Strategy
    * Bridge
    * ActiveRecord vs TransactionScript
    * Singleton and Multiton
    * more? you!

  Pizza/networking starts at 5:30 or so, fishbowl starts at 6:00.
