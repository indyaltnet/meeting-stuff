synopsis: |
  Lightning Talks:
    * HTML5
    * OAuth
    * Google Closure
    * Code Contracts
    * Kanban
    * more...

  Do you have a topic you want to talk about?  Bring it, and we'll try to squeeze you in!
   
  Groundrules:
    - Have Fun.
    - You get 10 minutes.  (We'll give you a 'warning' at 9 minutes)
    - If it takes longer than 2 minutes to get set up (war paint, projector/slides, suspenders) we'll throw rotten tomatoes at you (I'm bringing a whole cooler full, the recent frosts killed them all).
    - Be Awesome (or un-awesome, whichever floats your boat).

    title: Another package manager that is more than just NuPack (actually, it can use NuPack as a package source).  Written by Seb Lambla as a more complete solution.
