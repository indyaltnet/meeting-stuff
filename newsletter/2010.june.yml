synopsis: |
  TDD is tough and can be a bear to actually get started practicing.
  Phil Japikse (@skimedic) is going to host a Dojo for us so we can practice our TDD skills.
  Come prepared to get up and write a test or two, and feel free to bring your laptop and follow along as well.
 
  Note: Important Driving Directions!
  If you're coming via 465 or Northbound on Meridian, you'll be well served to hop off of Meridian just North of 465 onto 103rd St (East), and then back North on Pennsylvania.  This should save you ~10-15 minutes of traffic.
