synopsis: |
  It's our 3rd birthday, and we're having an all out RIA smackdown.
    - Not sure which platform to pick?
    - Not sure the capabilities of each?
    - Want to see a similar app developed in Silverlight, Flex, and jQuery?
    - Want to make fun of the JavaFX dudes (and dudettes!)?
  
  Did I mention it was our birthday?
  The terrible two's are over, and we're going to give out a ton of swag to kick off our third year:
    - TONS of books (literally, my arms are sore)
    - Windows 7
    - JetBrains license
    - TekPub videos
    - Telerik and Infragistics licenses
    - Laptops
    - no wait, nix the laptops
    - more
