synopsis: |
  Have you heard the old saying about, “Do you have 10 years of experience, or the one year ten times over.”  
  Practice will help ensure that you make the most out of your time.  Understand the theory of practice and how to build it in to your daily activities.
 
  Note: Important Driving Directions!
  If you're coming via 465 or Northbound on Meridian, you'll be well served to hop off of Meridian just North of 465 onto 103rd St (East), and then back North on Pennsylvania.  This should save you ~10-15 minutes of traffic.
