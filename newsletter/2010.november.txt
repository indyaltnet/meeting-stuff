In our industry’s continual effort to find a better way to provide software solutions, Lean software development practices are gaining some momentum.
Kanban is one part of Lean, and one I’ve used to provide value to my team and my clients in a very short time. I’ll share some of my experiences with Kanban, and help you generate some ideas on places you can use it

Note: Important Driving Directions!
If you're coming via 465 or Northbound on Meridian, you'll be well served to hop off of Meridian just North of 465 onto 103rd St (East), and then back North on Pennsylvania.  This should save you ~10-15 minutes of traffic.

** Food **
Pizza and networking will begin around 5:15 with the technology discussion beginning at 6:00.

** Location **
Meridian Mark II (room 150, just past the elevators on the right)
