synopsis: |
  WTF is a WTF lightning talk?
  This is an opportunity for you to brag/sob about your latest and greatest/worst snafus (and hopefully a lesson or two you learned from it).
   
  Groundrules:
    - Have Fun.
    - Before you rag on your co-workers/boss/significant other, rag on yourself first.
    - You get 8 minutes.  (We'll give you a 'warning' at 7 minutes)
    - If it takes longer than 2 minutes to get set up (war paint, projector/slides, suspenders) you've gotta sing Imma Be a Little Teapot.
    - Be Awesome (or un-awesome, whichever floats your boat).

  Be ready for a fun time.  And if this degenerates into an awkward Jr. High after school dance (you know, the kind where everyone is a wall-flower), we may have an ad-hoc something else happen too.
