            o Do they bother me too much?
            o Why does no-one get anything done?
            o How much interruption is appropriate?
      * Oddly Shaped Teams
            o What do you do when you don't have a tester?

  Note: Important Driving Directions!
  If you're coming via 465 or Northbound on Meridian, you'll be well served to hop off of Meridian just North of 465 onto 103rd St (East), and then back North on Pennsylvania.  This should save you ~10-15 minutes of traffic.
