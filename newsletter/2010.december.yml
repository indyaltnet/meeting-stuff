synopsis: |
  The core of your application is not twiddling bits to make pretty pictures on a screen.  It is about doing business things with business objects.  Domain Specific Languages allow you to program in a way that make those business objects dance, like sugar plum fairies.  We'll cover how DSLs separate concerns and allow for clearer communication with stakeholders. Also covered, how to implement internal (DSLs in your code) and external (DSLs that are parsed) DSLs.
   
  Pizza/networking starts at 5:30 or so, talks start at 6:00.
